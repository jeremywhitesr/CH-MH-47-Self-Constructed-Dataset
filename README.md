H47 HUMS Dataset SAMPLE (Handmade hypothetical dataset for IN311 Capstone Project)
This is my handmade dataset that I made for the use of IN311 for my Capstone Project. The Professor is well aware, but I was unfortunately unable to find an ACTUAL dataset due restrictions, clasifications etc. The dataset closely mirrors a real "HUMS Download" (to the best of my recollection) in terms of the data you will see from each system, time stamps, etc. Real "events" can be loaded into the dataset to simulate things that can be used for predictive maintenance purposes.
